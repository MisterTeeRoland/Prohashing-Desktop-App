# Prohashing Monitor App

## Preface

This electron app was built as a standalone application to view the current balances and worker information from Prohashing.com.

This application has no affiliation with Prohashing.com nor its employees. This was built as a side project and is not liable for any mining or trading decisions made based on the data from this app.

## About the App

The app itself is divided into 3 sections: Earnings, Workers, and Pool. Each tab will provide real-time and up-to-date information about your current earnings from mining, your currently connected workers and their hashrates, and relevant pool stats like overall hashrates and profitability per algorithm.

## How to Use

To get the most use from the application, you will need to supply a personal API key from Prohashing.com. Your API key will grant you access to view the earnings and workers connected to your account.

Simply copy and paste your API key into the Settings tab and click save to start getting your data.

You can also change the currency to display balances in. The default is USD, but you can view current and accurate prices in BTC, ETH, LTC, AUD, CAD, and more.

## Security

All data is stored locally on your device, and never sent to the cloud or database service. You do not have to worry about other users' access to your passwords or API keys.
